# 'Bout-Time
Treehouse | iOS TechDegree - Project 3

**Instructions**

For this project, you will be building an actual game, 'Bout Time, from the ground up.

Specifically, the game involves users taking historical events and seeing if they can put them in the correct chronological order. A single round of play consists 
of ordering four random events, and there are six rounds in each full game. You will not only write the code to build the user interface, you will also decide 
what kind of events to quiz the user about. We hope you embrace this aspect of the project and pick a topic you will enjoy - it will help you stay motivated and 
be more fun to show off when you are done.

To get an "exceeds" rating, you can expand on the project in the following ways:

* Add a feature such that at the end of each round, the users can tap on an event and be presented with a WebView or SafariViewController which will show a web page 
(such as Wikipedia) with related information. Users can close the webview and resume game play.
